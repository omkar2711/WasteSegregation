    <h1>Smart Waste Segregation System</h1>
    <p>Inefficient waste management practices, particularly the lack of segregation between dry and wet waste, have led to significant environmental challenges. Most households and public spaces currently dispose of waste in mixed form, making recycling and decomposition processes nearly impossible. This results in a growing demand for landfills and exacerbates environmental concerns.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The proposed Smart Waste Segregation System aims to address the pressing issue of mixed waste by automating the separation process. By efficiently segregating dry and wet waste, this system promotes recycling and decomposition, reducing the need for landfills and minimizing the environmental impact of improper waste disposal.</p>
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Automated Segregation:</strong> Separates dry and wet waste efficiently at the source</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Monitoring:</strong> Provides immediate alerts for any issues or maintenance requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Benefits:</strong> Reduces the demand for landfills and promotes recycling and decomposition.</li>
        <li><strong>Remote Monitoring:</strong> Enables remote access and monitoring for efficient waste management.</li>
        <li><strong>Smartphone App Integration:</strong> Connects with smartphones to provide convenient updates and information.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Automated Segregation:</strong> The Smart Waste Segregation System separates dry and wet waste as it is disposed of, ensuring proper categorization.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> All data collected during the segregation process is stored and can be analyzed to improve waste management strategies.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Monitoring:</strong> The system continuously monitors dry or wet waste and seperate it to dispose and provides immediate alerts for any mishandling.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>To use the Smart Waste Segregation System, follow the instructions provided in the <a href="https://github.com/omkar2711/WasteSegregation/blob/main/Smart%20Waste%20Segregation%20System%20Final%20report.docx">User Manual</a>.</p>
